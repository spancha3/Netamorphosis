# WE NEEDED TO FIND THE MONTH THEY'RE LIKELY TO CONTACT THE MOST CLIENTS, SO THEY CAN SCHEDULE A PRODUCT UPGRADE ANNOUNCEMENT. WHICH MONTH DOES THE TEAM TEND TO CONTACT THE GREATEST PERCENTAGE OF ITS CLIENTS:

First, we download the data into local directory and viewed it using R Studio.

We install the necessary packages/ libraries to view the Excel Data
Confirm the data type and also check for null values to make sure the data is complete

Get the summary of the data; Identify the dimension of data and also identify unique values in the data for each column viz. Client Name, Account Manager Name and Date of Contact

Identify the extreme elements in each column viz. Client Name, Account Manager Name and Date of Contact

Split the Date column into three separate columns viz. into YEAR, MONTH and DATE

Now, we can visualize each particular month's value for client interaction

From the derived graph, it was observed that the month of October has the most contacts over all the years and hence should be the preferred month of announcement.

Graph can be viewed by opening the file named- "Count each Month.jpeg"
